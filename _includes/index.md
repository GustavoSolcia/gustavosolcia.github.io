Computational physics PhD student working to enable the use of magnetic resonance imaging for computational fluid dynamics of brain arteries.

You can see my studies on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gustavo_Solcia) and my codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GustavoSolcia).

I'm currently working and helping other students on several projects from [my lab organization](https://github.com/CIERMag-FFPaivaStudents).
