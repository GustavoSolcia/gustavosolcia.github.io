Over the years being an academic I had the opportunity to
travel and run in some beautiful places. 
I will use this post to share some photos that I took
from my favorite running spots and give a few advices.
I hope you will enjoy!

Rio de Janeiro
======
Rio is probably the place that comes to your mind when you think about Brazil. 
If you are visiting for your first time, you definetly should do all the turistic things.
However, if you are also a runner, you can't let go the oportunity to run in the 
Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas (photo) and in Ipanema/Leblon beach. In weekdays the lagoa (lagoon) is 
a no-brainer and specially during the hollidays/sundays
the avenue in front of the beach is closed and you can enjoy it better.

Oxford
======
Oxford was a life-changing experience because of all the amazing friends that I made 
and the knowledge I earned during my visit. There are many beautiful places to run in Oxford and
you could just run in the city centre and be amazed. Then, I will open an exception and post two photos in 
this section. The first one is somewhere between New Marston and the University Parks in a common route that I
used to take. The second photo I decided to post to show how exploring Oxford city centre is also great!

Fortaleza
======
Fortaleza is the best running experience alongside a beach. The huge Beira Mar combined with 
dedicated cycling and running space is really cool. But running in the early morning (5 a.m.) or at night 
is recommended because of the heat. Don't forget to have a coconut water at the end!

Búzios
======
Búzios has a special combination of beach and gastronomy. Running the Brigitte Bardot shore (yes, the actress!) and in the 
rua das pedras (rock street) is a tough competition with Fortaleza. The only downside is that the shore plus street 
can be quite a short run. But don't be sad, you can always go back at night and enjoy the delicious food!

Araraquara
======
Araraquara is my hometown and of course I had to mention in my list! In the photo I show the Parque Botânico (Botanic Park).
It's a park close to my parents house with amazing running routes and with its own football stadium. 
You should definetly go in the sunday morning and also 
enjoy the local farmers market.
