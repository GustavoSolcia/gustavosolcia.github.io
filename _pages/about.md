# Wellcome to my website!

I'm a Computational Physics Ph.D. passionate about MRI and doing simulations.
During my Ph.D. I worked with CFD using MRI data for obtaining 
the structure and boundary conditions for simulations.
I also love to go for a run in my free time. 
In this website you can expect to find everything from MRI, computers, and 
running!

**I'm currently applying for postdoctoral fellowships and looking for jobs. 
Please, contact me if you know any opportunity!**
